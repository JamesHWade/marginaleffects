## Motivation

Parameter estimates are often hard to interpret substantively, especially when they are generated by complex models with non-linear components or transformations. Many applied researchers would rather focus on simple quantities of interest, which have straightforward scientific interpretations. Unfortunately, these estimands (and their standard errors) are often tedious to calculate. Moreover, the different modeling packages in `R` often produce inconsistent objects that require special treatment.

`marginaleffects` offers a single point of entry to easily interpret the results of over `r n_support` classes of models, using a simple and consistent user interface.

Benefits of `marginaleffects` include:

* _Powerful:_ It can compute predictions, comparisons (contrasts, risk ratios, etc.), slopes, and conduct hypothesis tests for `r n_support` different classes of models in `R`.
* _Simple:_ All functions share a simple, unified, and well-documented interface.
* _Efficient:_ [Some operations](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/performance.html) are orders of magnitude faster than with the `margins` package, and the memory footprint is much smaller.
* _Valid:_  When possible, [numerical results are checked](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/supported_models.html) against alternative software like `Stata` or other `R` packages.
* _Thin:_ Few dependencies.
* _Standards-compliant:_ `marginaleffects` follows "tidy" principles and returns objects that work with standard functions like `plot`, `summary()`, `tidy()`, and `glance()`. These objects are easy to program with and feed to [other packages like `modelsummary`.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/) 
* _Extensible:_ Adding support for new models is very easy, often requiring less than 10 lines of new code. Please submit [feature requests on Github.](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues)
* _Active development_: Bugs are fixed promptly.

Downsides of `marginaleffects` include:

* No multiplicity adjustments. (Use `p.adjust()` instead.)
* Marginal means are often slower to compute than with `emmeans`.
* No omnibus test

If `marginaleffects` does not meet your needs, I recommend you try [`emmeans`](https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans) or one of the other [alternative `R` packages.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/alternative_software.html)

## Installation

You can install the released version of `marginaleffects` from CRAN:

**Restart `R` completely before moving on.** 

## Estimands: Predictions, Comparisons, and Slopes

The `marginaleffects` package allows `R` users to compute and plot three principal quantities of interest for [`r n_support` different classes of models:](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/supported_models.html) Predictions, Comparisons (contrasts, risk ratios, etc.), and Slopes. In addition, the package includes a convenience function to estimate "marginal means", whis is a special case of "aggregated" prediction.

WARNING: unit-level quantities

### Predictions

[_Predictions_](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/predictions.html) 

- The outcome predicted by a fitted model on a specified scale for a given combination of values of the predictor variables, such as their observed values, their means, or factor levels (a.k.a. "reference grid").
- a.k.a. "Fitted values", "Adjusted predictions"
- [`predictions(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/predictions.html) [`plot_cap()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/predictions.html)

### Comparisons

[_Comparisons_](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html)

- The difference between two predictions, calculated for meaningfully different predictor values (e.g., College graduates vs. Others). Instead of a difference, comparisons can be constructed using other functions of two adjusted predictions, such as a ratio.
- e.g., "Contrasts", "Risk ratios", etc.
- [`comparisons(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/comparisons.html) [`plot_cco()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot_cco.html)

### Slopes

[_Slopes_](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/slopes.html) 

- Partial derivatives of the regression equation with respect to a regressor of interest.
- a.k.a. "Marginal effects", "Trends"
- [`slopes(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/slopes.html) [`plot(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot.slopes.html) [`plot_cme()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot_cme.html)

### Marginal means

* [_Marginal Means_](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/marginalmeans.html) 
    - Adjusted predictions of a model, averaged across a "reference grid" of categorical predictors.
    - [`marginalmeans()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/marginalmeans.html)

### What does "marginal" mean?

One confusing aspect of the definitions above is that they use the word "marginal" in two different and *opposite* ways: 

1. In "marginal effects," we refer to the effect of a tiny (marginal) change in the regressor on the outcome. This is a slope, or derivative. 
2. In "marginal means," we refer to the process of marginalizing across rows of a prediction grid. This is an average, or integral. 

Another potential confusion arises when some analysts use "marginal" to distinguish some estimates from "conditional" ones. As noted in [the marginal effects](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/slopes.html) and [the contrasts](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html) vignettes, slopes and contrasts often vary from individual to individual, based on the values of all the regressors in the model. When we estimate a slope or a contrast for a specific combination of predictors -- for one (possibly representative) individual -- some people will call this a "conditional" estimate. When we compute the average of several individual-level estimates, some people will call this a "marginal" estimate. 

On this website and in this package, we will reserve the expression "marginal effect" to mean a "slope" or "derivative". When we take the average unit-level estimates, we will call this an "average marginal effect."

This is all very confusing, but the terminology is so widespread and inconsistent that we must press on...


## Getting started

#### Adjusted predictions

To begin, we estimate a linear regression model with multiplicative interactions:

```{r}
library(marginaleffects)

mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp * wt * am, data = mtcars)
```

An "adjusted prediction" is the outcome predicted by a model for some combination of the regressors' values, such as their observed values, their means, or factor levels (a.k.a. “reference grid”).

By default, the `predictions()` function returns adjusted predictions for every value in original dataset:

```{r}
predictions(mod) |> head()
```

The [`datagrid` function gives us a powerful way to define a grid of predictors.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/datagrid.html) All the variables not mentioned explicitly in `datagrid()` are fixed to their mean or mode:

```{r}
predictions(mod, newdata = datagrid(am = 0, wt = seq(2, 3, .2)))
```

We can plot how predictions change for different values of one or more variables -- Conditional Adjusted Predictions -- using the `plot_cap` function:

```{r}
plot_cap(mod, condition = c("hp", "wt"))
```

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
plot_cap(mod2, condition = "cyl")
```

[The Adjusted Predictions vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/predictions.html) shows how to use the `predictions()` and `plot_cap()` functions to compute a wide variety of quantities of interest:

* Adjusted Predictions at User-Specified Values (aka Predictions at Representative Values)
* Adjusted Predictions at the Mean
* Average Predictions at the Mean
* Conditional Predictions
* Adjusted Predictions on different scales (e.g., link or response)

#### Contrasts

A contrast is the difference between two adjusted predictions, calculated for meaningfully different predictor values (e.g., College graduates vs. Others).

What happens to the predicted outcome when a numeric predictor increases by one unit, and logical variable flips from FALSE to TRUE, and a factor variable shifts from baseline?

```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv")
titanic$Woman <- titanic$Sex == "female"
mod3 <- glm(Survived ~ Woman + Age * PClass, data = titanic, family = binomial)

cmp <- comparisons(mod3)
summary(cmp)
```

The contrast above used a simple difference between adjusted predictions. We can also used different functions to combine and contrast predictions in different ways. For instance, researchers often compute Adjusted Risk Ratios, which are ratios of predicted probabilities. We can compute such ratios by applying a transformation using the `transform_pre` argument. We can also present the results of "interactions" between contrasts. 
What happens to the ratio of predicted probabilities for survival when `PClass` changes between each pair of factor levels ("pairwise") and `Age` changes by 2 standard deviations simultaneously:

```{r}
cmp <- comparisons(
    mod3,
    transform_pre = "ratio",
    variables = list(Age = "2sd", PClass = "pairwise"))
summary(cmp)
```

The code above is explained in detail in the [vignette on Transformations and Custom Contrasts.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/transformation.html)

[The Contrasts vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html) shows how to use the `comparisons()` function to compute a wide variety of quantities of interest:

* Custom comparisons for:
  - Numeric variables (e.g., 1 standard deviation, interquartile range, custom values)
  - Factor or character
  - Logical
* Contrast interactions
* Unit-level Contrasts
* Average Contrasts
* Group-Average Contrasts
* Contrasts at the Mean
* Contrasts Between Marginal Means
* Adjusted Risk Ratios

#### Marginal effects

A "marginal effect" is a partial derivative (slope) of the regression equation with respect to a regressor of interest. It is unit-specific measure of association between a change in a regressor and a change in the regressand. The `slopes()` function uses numerical derivatives to estimate the slope of the regression equation with respect to each of the variables in the model (or contrasts for categorical variables). 

By default, `slopes()` estimates the slope for each row of the original dataset that was used to fit the model:

```{r}
mfx <- slopes(mod)

head(mfx, 4)
```

The function `summary` calculates the "Average Marginal Effect," that is, the average of all unit-specific marginal effects:

```{r}
summary(mfx)
```

The `plot_cme` plots "Conditional Marginal Effects," that is, the marginal effects estimated at different values of a regressor (often an interaction):

```{r}
plot_cme(mod, effect = "hp", condition = c("wt", "am"))
```

[The Marginal Effects vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/slopes.html) shows how to use the `slopes()` function to compute a wide variety of quantities of interest:

* Unit-level Marginal Effects
* Average Marginal Effects
* Group-Average Marginal Effects
* Marginal Effects at the Mean
* Marginal Effects Between Marginal Means
* Conditional Marginal Effects
* Tables and Plots

#### Marginal means

Marginal Means are the adjusted predictions of a model, averaged across a “reference grid” of categorical predictors. To compute marginal means, we first need to make sure that the categorical variables of our model are coded as such in the dataset:

```{r}
dat <- mtcars
dat$am <- as.logical(dat$am)
dat$cyl <- as.factor(dat$cyl)
```

Then, we estimate the model and call the `marginalmeans` function:

```{r}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ am + cyl + hp, data = dat)
mm <- marginalmeans(mod)
summary(mm)
```

[The Marginal Means vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/marginalmeans.html) offers more detail.
