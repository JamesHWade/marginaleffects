## Interpreting statistical models with `marginaleffects` for `R` and `Python`

Parameter estimates are often hard to interpret substantively,
especially when they are generated by complex models with non-linear
components, interactions, or transformations. Instead of reporting
unintuitive parameters, data analysts would rather focus on simple
quantities of interest, which have straightforward scientific
interpretations. Unfortunately, meaningful estimands—and their standard
errors—are often tedious to compute, and the terminology used to
describe them varies tremendously across fields.

These problems are compounded by the fact that modeling packages produce
objects with very different structures and which hold different
information. This means that end-users often have to write customized
code to interpret the output of Linear, GLM, GAM, Bayesian, Mixed
Effects, and other model types. This can lead to wasted effort,
confusion, and mistakes, and it can hinder the implementation of best
practices.

This online book introduces a conceptual framework and software tools to
facilitate the interpretation of a vast range of statistical models in
`R` and `Python`. The `marginaleffects` package supports over [100
classes](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/supported_models.html) of
statistical models, including linear, GLM, GAM, mixed-effects, bayesian,
categorical outcomes, and more. With a single unified interface, users
can compute and plot many quantities of interest, including:

-   Predictions (aka fitted values or adjusted predictions)
-   Comparisons such as risk differences, risk ratios, odds, etc.
-   Slopes (aka marginal effects)
-   Marginal means
-   Linear and non-linear hypothesis tests
-   Equivalence tests
-   Uncertainty estimates using the delta method, bootstrapping,
    simulation, or conformal inference.

[The Marginal Effects Zoo](https://marginaleffects.com/) is a free
online book with over 30 chapters full of tutorials, case studies, and
technical notes. It covers a wide range of topics, including how the
`marginaleffects` package can facilitate the interpreation of analysis
of:

-   Experiments
-   Machine learning models
-   Causal inference with G-Computation
-   Bayesian modeling
-   Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP)
-   Missing data imputation
-   Matching
-   Inverse probability weighting
-   Conformal prediction
