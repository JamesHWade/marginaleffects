## Why?

Parameter estimates are often hard to interpret substantively,
especially when they are generated by complex models with non-linear
components, interactions, or transformations. Instead of reporting
unintuitive parameters, data analysts would rather focus on simple
quantities of interest, which have straightforward scientific
interpretations. Unfortunately, meaningful estimands—and their standard
errors—are often tedious to compute, and the terminology used to
describe them varies tremendously across fields.

These problems are compounded by the fact that modeling packages produce
objects with very different structures and which hold different
information. This means that end-users often have to write customized
code to interpret the output of different models. This can lead to
wasted effort, confusion, and mistakes, and it can hinder the
implementation of best practices.

## What?

This online book introduces a conceptual framework and the
`marginaleffects` package for `R` and `Python`. This software can
facilitate the interpretation of [over 100 classes of statistical
models](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/supported_models.html) in
`R` and `Python`, including linear, GLM, GAM, mixed-effects, bayesian,
categorical outcomes, and more. With a single unified interface, users
can compute and plot many quantities of interest, including:

-   Predictions (aka fitted values or adjusted predictions)
-   Comparisons such as risk differences, risk ratios, odds, etc.
-   Slopes (aka marginal effects)
-   Marginal means
-   Linear and non-linear hypothesis tests
-   Equivalence tests
-   Uncertainty estimates using the delta method, bootstrapping,
    simulation, or conformal inference.
-   Much more!

[The Marginal Effects Zoo](https://marginaleffects.com/) is a free
online book with over 30 chapters of tutorials, case studies, and
technical notes. It covers a wide range of topics, including how the
`marginaleffects` package can facilitate the analysis of:

-   Experiments
-   Observational data
-   Causal inference with G-Computation
-   Machine learning models
-   Bayesian modeling
-   Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP)
-   Missing data
-   Matching
-   Inverse probability weighting
-   Conformal prediction
